# Sports Facts
## This is a mini command line project which asks the user if they would like to know some sports facts

### If the answer is yes:
The program asks them to choose a sport and a number and prints out the number of facts about that sport.
It will ask if they would like to play again and runs the function again if the answer is yes

### If the answer is no:
The program replies with a short message: "Maybe another time"

### If the answer is neither:
The program states that the answer was not of a recognised format and asks again until the answer is acceptable
